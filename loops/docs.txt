Python Loops:
   Python has two primitive loop commands:
   1) while loops
   2) for loops

   A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, 
   a set, or a string). The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.
   The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready.


The range() Function:
   To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function.
   The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments 
   by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.
   The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify 
   the increment value by adding a third parameter.

   Note: The else block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement.
